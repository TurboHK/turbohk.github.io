                  We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:<br><br>
                  (1) Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as the content you create or upload.<br>

                  When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form.
