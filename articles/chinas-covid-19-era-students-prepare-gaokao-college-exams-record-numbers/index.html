                    A record number of Chinese students are set to take this year’s national college entrance exams as the country battles its worst Covid-19 outbreak in two years. Many have spent the bulk of their high school studies under pandemic restrictions.<br><br>
                    About 11.93 million students – 1.15 million more than last year – are expected to sit the exams this year, most of them between June 7 and 10, according to the Ministry of Education. Shanghai, which recently ended months of lockdown, is set to hold them a month later.<br><br>
                    In China, the national college entrance exams – gaokao – are taken by most high school students hoping for an undergraduate education. It is widely considered the country’s most important exam, which can make or break a young person’s future.<br><br>
                    The exam is a pivotal moment, in large part determining whether Chinese students can go to university, which institutions they will be admitted to, and what careers await them.<br><br>
                    Most of this year’s entrants started high school in September 2019, months before the Covid-19 pandemic which has plagued their education journey. They have adapted to remote learning, pandemic restrictions, psychological pressure and sometimes even food shortages.<br><br>
                    “The pandemic has greatly affected my high school life and studies,” said Bobo, a student in Xinjiang. “The studying time [for new knowledge] is only two years, but our class of 2022 has been in lockdown for eight months.”<br><br>
                    Bobo has been through two lockdowns in the past two years. Classes were moved online and she had to learn difficult content via live-streaming apps, which she found ineffective, harder to digest and painful to her eyes.<br><br>
                    Technical issues also abounded, with bad Wi-fi connections and some teachers unfamiliar with the online tutorial apps. And, with no printer, she was unable to practice for the gaokao on paper tests at home.<br><br>
                    Bobo said she had to develop a high level of self-control or would end up idling, playing with her smartphone or taking a nap during online classes.<br><br>
                    Since returning to school at the start of the year, with limited time to prepare for the gaokao, Bobo is finding it hard to make up for the disruption. “We are the victims of the pandemic,” she said.<br><br>
                    Schools remain closed in Shanghai, the financial hub which formally lifted a two-month citywide lockdown this week, and its students will sit the exams from July 7 to 9.

                    Students in years 11 and 12 would be allowed to return to campus from June 6, Yang Zhenfeng, deputy director of the Shanghai education commission, said last month.<br><br>
                    But 18-year-old Lin Yanran, from Shanghai Jinling Middle School, said the delayed exams might not necessarily be good news for the city’s students.<br><br>
                    While she initially welcomed the extra month to prepare, Lin said her reaction to the news changed when she found out Shanghai was the only city in China to postpone the exams.<br><br>
                    “When other students are set free, we have to study for one more month,” Lin said. “Before the announcement, I had entered the ‘critical sprint period’ for gaokao, so the postponement will actually make me slack.”<br><br>
                    Xinyue, another high school senior in Shanghai, said she felt guilty for finding it hard to stay positive and focused since turning to online classes on March 12. “I always feel that I haven’t tried my best.”<br><br>
                    She described feeling a lack of urgency while studying online at home, and being “vulnerable to the temptation and influence of the outside world”, including anxiety from reading bad news about increasing infections in a city under lockdown.<br><br>
                    “I think this year’s pandemic is beneficial to students who are more self-motivated and have a higher level of self-control,” she said. “But it’s not good for students with low self-control like me.”<br><br>

                    Chen Mo, a child and adolescent psychologist based in Shanghai, said anxiety was common among exam-goers, but the lockdowns meant she has seen a rise in cases involving parent-child confrontations.<br><br>
                    Chen said she has seen more family counselling cases through online or phone consultations this year. “Seven in 10 of the kids are from Shanghai.”<br><br>
                    Her advice to families was to take the heat out of the situation. “Parents should calm down first, lower their expectations for their children, and reduce the anxiety or the students cannot devote energy to the tests,” she said.<br><br>
                    For most Chinese, especially those from less privileged backgrounds, a high gaokao score is their only means to significantly alter their fate. A commonly heard refrain about gaokao is that “one test determines a life”.<br><br>
                    The emphasis on test scores should be reconsidered, according to Xiong Bingqi, director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, who has proposed two ways to change the public’s mindset about the national exams.<br><br>
                    “One is to reform gaokao. We should establish a diverse, comprehensive evaluation system, not only relying on this single exam,” he said.<br><br>
                    The second is to break the traditional view that only academics and prestigious schools matter. “We can’t evaluate or choose a person only based on his or her academic background.”
